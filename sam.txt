AWS Handbook:

1) Go to course invitation, and click on get started. You will be redirected to the course page where they will ask to log in with your canvas account. If you don't have one then create.

2) You will see your dashboard, now click on Modules -> Launch AWS Academy Learner Lab.

3) Click on Start Lab and what for the AWS signal to turn green. After Green click on that AWS.

4) Redirected to a new page, Click on EC2 -> Launch Instance.

5) Give a name, select Ubuntu (in options select anything in the free tier list), Make sure AMI arch is 64 bit, Instance type (anything in free tier) t3 micro (if free), Click on create new Key Pair.

6) Give a key pair name, Select RSA and .pem file format.

7) Go to your File Explorer -> Desktop -> Create a folder named AWS and now store the .pem file in this AWS folder.

8) In Network settings check all boxes (Allow SSH, HTTPS, HTTP).

9) Select Storage 8GB

10) Click on Launch instance. You will see a green color message.

11) Go to instances, you can see your instance, so wait for it to be initialized. You will see 2 or 3 tests passes.

12) Now check the box and click on connect. This means your instance is now running on server.

13) You will be redirected to a page where they will ask you to Connect to instance, click on SSH client and copy the full ssh -i command.

14) Now copy the .pem file path in our AWS folder. Open Powershell in administrator mode and paste our path.

cd (path)

15) now paste that ssh command you copied.

16) run the pasted ssh -i command in the terminal.

17) next run the following commands:

-> sudo apt update (updates all softwares in Ubuntu)
-> sudo apt-get install docker.io
-> sudo apt install git
-> sudo apt install nano

18) Open Maven WEB PROJECT REPO from GitHub and copy the http link.

19) Clone the Repo (git clone httpslink) . Then type ls (you will see all folers nd files) type cd (your maven projectnsme)

20) Now type -> nano Dockerfile -> A GNU nano version appears and write the following data and click crtl+o enter and then ctrl-x:
	FROM tomcat:9-jdk11
	COPY target/*.wat/usr/local/tomcat/webapps

21) type sudo docker build -t yourmavenprojectname .

22) Now to run the container, type:

sudo docker run -d -p 9090:8080 yourmavenprojectname

23) Now go to your instance there you will see your IPv4 address copy it and paste it in a new tab URL. If your web app isn't loaded of your url starts with https, then type http in place of https.

24) If your app is not running goto security  and Click on security group -> Click on edit inbound rules -> Click on add rule give port as 9090 and 0.0.0.0/0 click on save.

25) Now refresh the page to check whether the web page has loaded or not. If loaded then you have successfully deployed your maven web project 🥳

26) ***** IMPORTANT ******

after showing the deployment don't forget to run the command sudo docker ps, to stop the container. Then go to your instance dashboard click on instance state dropdown and then select Terminate (delete) instance. Then go to your AWS Academy Learner Lab and click on End Lab


Here’s a clean, well-formatted **AWS Handbook** guide for deploying a Maven web project using AWS Academy Learner Lab:

***

**AWS Handbook – Step-by-Step Guide**

**1. Course Enrollment & Dashboard Access**
- Go to the course invitation and click **Get Started**.
- You’ll be redirected to the course page. Log in using your Canvas account (create one if you don’t have it).
- After logging in, you’ll see your dashboard.

**2. Launch AWS Academy Learner Lab**
- Navigate to **Modules → Launch AWS Academy Learner Lab**.
- Click **Start Lab** and wait for the AWS signal to turn green.
- Once green, click on the AWS icon.

**3. Launch an EC2 Instance**
- On the new page, click **EC2 → Launch Instance**.
- Provide a name for your instance.
- Select **Ubuntu** (choose any option from the free tier list).
- Ensure the AMI architecture is **64-bit**.
- For Instance Type, select something in the free tier (e.g., t3.micro if available).
- Click **Create New Key Pair**.

**4. Key Pair Setup**
- Name your key pair, select **RSA** and **.pem** as the file format.
- Create a folder named `AWS` on your Desktop and store the `.pem` file there.

**5. Configure Instance**
- In **Network Settings**, enable SSH, HTTPS, and HTTP.
- Set **Storage** to **8GB**.
- Click **Launch Instance** and look for a green success message.

**6. Check Instance Status**
- Go to **Instances** to see your instance initializing (wait until tests pass).
- Check the instance box and click **Connect** (your server is now running).

**7. SSH Connection**
- On the connection page, select **SSH client** and copy the full `ssh -i` command.
- Copy the path of your `.pem` file in the AWS folder.
- Open PowerShell in administrator mode, navigate to the AWS folder:
  ```bash
  cd <path-to-AWS-folder>
  ```
- Paste and run the `ssh -i` command to connect to your EC2 instance.

**8. Install Required Packages**
- Run the following commands in the terminal:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update          # Update all software in Ubuntu
  sudo apt-get install docker.io
  sudo apt install git
  sudo apt install nano
  ```

**9. Clone Maven Project**
- Open your Maven web project repo on GitHub and copy the HTTPS link.
- Clone the repo:
  ```bash
  git clone <https-git-link>
  ls                       # List all folders and files
  cd <your-maven-project-name>
  ```

**10. Create a Dockerfile**
- Type:
  ```bash
  nano Dockerfile
  ```
- In nano editor, enter:
  ```
  FROM tomcat:9-jdk11
  COPY target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps
  ```
- Save with `Ctrl+O`, then press Enter, then exit with `Ctrl+X`.

**11. Build and Run Docker Container**
- Build the Docker image:
  ```bash
  sudo docker build -t yourmavenprojectname .
  ```
- Run the container:
  ```bash
  sudo docker run -d -p 9090:8080 yourmavenprojectname
  ```

**12. Access Your Web App**
- Get your instance’s IPv4 address.
- Paste it in a new browser tab URL:  
  `http://<IPv4-address>:9090`
- If the app doesn’t load (or the URL defaults to HTTPS), switch to HTTP.

**13. Troubleshooting: Security Groups**
- If your app isn't running, edit your security group:
  - Click **Security Group** → **Edit Inbound Rules** → **Add Rule**
    - Port: **9090**
    - Source: **0.0.0.0/0**
  - Click **Save**.
- Refresh the page to check if your web app is now loaded.

**14. Stopping & Terminating Resources**
- After successful deployment, run:
  ```bash
  sudo docker ps    # See running containers
  ```
- To stop the container, go to your instance dashboard:
  - Click **Instance State** dropdown → **Terminate (delete) instance**.
- Return to **AWS Academy Learner Lab** and click **End Lab**.

***

**Congratulations!** If your webpage loads, you’ve successfully deployed your Maven web project 🥳.  
**IMPORTANT:** Always terminate your instance and end the lab after deployment to avoid unnecessary charges or usage.
